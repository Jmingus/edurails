# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

#20.times do
#  Company.create(name: Faker::Company.name )
#
#  Employee.create(name: Faker::Name.name, role: Faker::Commerce.department, job_title: Faker::Name.title )
#
#  Course.create(title: Faker::Hacker.adjective, reqs: Faker::Company.bs, enrollment_cap: rand(1..50))
#
#  Location.create(name: Faker::Address.city )
